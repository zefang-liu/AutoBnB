# AutoBnB: Backdoors & Breaches with AutoGen

This project investigates the use of large language models (LLMs) for enhancing collaboration and decision-making in cybersecurity incident response scenarios. Built on the *[AutoGen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/)* framework for multi-agent system simulation, it uses the *[Backdoors & Breaches](https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/projects/backdoorsandbreaches/)* tabletop game as a simulation platform to explore how LLM-based multi-agent systems perform under various team structures. Through these simulations, the project provides insights into optimizing team dynamics and strategies to counter cyber threats effectively.

## Installation

Set up the environment by installing the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Launch the simulation using the Jupyter notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook autobnb.ipynb
```
